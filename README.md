Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding datasets. Here's a concise summary of the steps followed in the EDA of the ABC company employee dataset:

Importing Libraries: Essential Python libraries were imported for data handling, analysis, and visualization.

Reading Dataset: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function.

Data Preprocessing: Initial exploration involved checking dimensions, data types, and missing values. Statistical summaries helped identify outliers and data distribution. Duplicates and null values were handled appropriately.

Data Analysis: Key insights were derived, such as salary distribution by team and identifying patterns within the dataset.

Data Visualization: Various plots, including scatter plots and bar plots, were used to visualize data relationships and distributions. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries facilitated visualization tasks.

This EDA process provided valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics, aiding in further analysis and decision-making processes.
